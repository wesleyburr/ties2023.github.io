<h3> Conference Theme </h3>
<p>
Environmetrics is the application and study of statistics centered on the environment. Recent growth in data science has reinforced that the key
skills of data science are integral to reproducible, replicable workflows in the scientific work already being done by researchers and practitioners
in environmetrics. This year's theme is <b>Experiment to Theory</b>: Breaking Down Barriers between Statistics and Environmental Science, and
the co-sponsorship of this meeting by the Canadian Environmental Modeling Centre and the Trent School of the Environment is hoped to bring a 
broad cross-section of environmental modelers to the meeting who would normally not have considered it as a destination. We hope the meeting of
minds between statisticians, environmental data scientists, environmental scientists, and environmental modelers will be very fruitful,
and spark numerous collaborations in the future.

Within the overall theme we will focus on the following topics:

<ul>
<li> <b> Topic 1: Climate, climate change, and climate systems </b> <br/>
	Climate change is an ever-present topic at our meetings. In addition, a broad cross-section of environmental science is interested
	in problems connecting to climate systems and climate change. 
</li>

<li> <b> Topic 2: Integrative data analysis</b><br/>
	Integrative data analysis is the pooling of two or more independent data sets for analysis. Ecological and environmental data are
	often recorded at wildly differing temporal and spatial scales, and the tools and methods for working with these data types
	are complex and multifaceted. We hope to see talks in this topic from both the side of the environmental data <i>gatherers</i>,
	and from the environmental data <i>modelers</i>.
</li>

<li> <b>Topic 3: Spatial and spatio-temporal modeling, statistics, and data governance</b><br/>
	Spatial data, spatio-temporal data, and the mathematical and statistical models that deal with their complexities. Also issues of
	data governance at large scales, to deal with the massive data sets that can result.
</li>


<li> <b>Topic 4: Ecological modeling</b><br/>
	Ecological data and modeling, from surface to sea depths. Models for animal population movement, fisheries stocks, and 
	other connected areas. Ecological transport models and habitat. 
</li>

<li> <b>Topic 5: Air Pollution Measuring, Monitoring, Modeling and Impacts</b><br/>
	Air pollution in its multitudinous forms, from particulate matter to carbon dioxide. Connections with remote sensing,
	and integrative data analysis. Questions of policy, from monitoring to impact measurement, including epidemiological
	applications.
</li>

<li> <b>Topic 6: Environmental data science</b><br/>
	Tool building, software development, workflow, processes for building, analyzing and integrating data. Hopeful connections to the
	recent pair of Special Issues on Environmental Data Science in <i>Environmetrics</i>.
</li>
	
</ul>

<p>
						A submission will require a short abstract (250-300 words), to be 
						<b>submitted by 17 March 2023</b> through <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ties2023">EasyChair</a>. Invited paper session
						proposals remain welcome, and must be <b>submitted by 27 February 2023</b> directly
						to the conference organizers, <a href="mailto:ties.meeting.2023@gmail.com">ties.meeting.2023@gmail.com</a>, and after acceptance, will be integrated into EasyChair.
