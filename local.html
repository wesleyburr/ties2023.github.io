        <h3>Housing</h3>
        <p>We have arranged for reserved residence housing for attendees interested in staying on campus.
        The rates are reasonable, and it will put you less than a 5 minute walk from the conference talks
        and food services. You can reserve accommodations for yourself using <a href="https://trentu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6GymI1dFTzLrbFQ" target="_blank">this</a> Qualtrics web-form,
        which connects directly to the Conference and Residence Services folks.</p>

        <p>Full link: <a href="https://trentu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6GymI1dFTzLrbFQ" target="_blank">https://trentu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6GymI1dFTzLrbFQ</a>.</p>

        <p>The details of the accommodation reservation are as follows:</p>

        <p>&nbsp;<br/>
        <b>Bed and Breakfast Accommodation rates:</b><br/>
            Gzowski College Accommodations 1 double bed per room, shared bathroom between two adjoining rooms. Each
            room made up with linens, towels, soap, and shampoo. Parking included as required for overnight guests.<br/>

            The nightly rate with Hot Breakfast Buffet is $92.00+HST per person (requires 30 attendees).
            If less than 30 attendees choose this option, we will have to default to the 
            Continental Breakfast option, which is $85.00+HST per person.<br/>
        </p>

      <p> Alternatively, there are several nice boutique hotels and standard motel options in 
      town: in particular the Holiday Inn Peterborough Waterfront and the Peterborough Inn and Suites Hotel
      are both centrally located in the downtown core, near most of the restaurants and pubs, and are
      very convenient for socializing and after-conference hours. The bus depot is less than 300m from
      both options, where you can catch one of the bus routes that will allow you to disembark at the
      door of the venue on the East Bank of the Trent campus.</p><br/>

      <p>We have not made a conference reservation at these hotels, so if you are interested, just use
      standard booking sites to get the best rates you can.</p>

      <h3>Transit in Peterborough</h3>
      <p> There is a reasonable bus system in Peterborough, that can get you around if you wish to explore
      the city and do not have access to a vehicle. The routes that are most applicable to you, since
      you will be spending much of the week on campus, are:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Route #6C Sherbrooke: Cross-city to campus via downtown terminal and Armour Road</li>
          <li>Route #7/7A Lansdowne: East side of river and Lansdowne to campus</li>
          <li>Route #9 Parkhill: Parkhill and west side of city to campus</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All three of these routes stop at the downtown Stewart Street bus terminal, and have stops
      on the East Bank of campus where you can get off at Gzowski College, which is where the housing
      reservations have been made. We will likely be eating there and having the talks there as well,
      although this has still to be finalized.</p>

      <h3>Travel to Peterborough</h3>
      <p>For those arriving from out of town and coming by air, the most convenient airport is
      Pearson International in Toronto. From that airport you can either take a rental car - 
      if you want the flexibility and access to a vehicle (note: Pearson is approximately 150km,
      and 90-120 minutes of driving from Peterborough) - or public transit. There is an excellent
      transit system in the Greater Toronto Area, and you can take a direct train from Pearson
      to the downtown Toronto terminal at Union Station, after which you can take GO Transit
      from Union Station to Peterborough via Oshawa (train from Union to Oshawa; coach from
      Oshawa to Peterborough). </p>

      <p>More details to come in the time between now and the conference.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p><br/>
<h3> Visas </h3>
<p> Delegates are advised to apply for visas well in advance of the conference, and before booking non-refundable flight tickets and accommodation. Some general information and links are provided here and will be updated as needed. <i>Please note we have no ability to speed up the visa process</i>.

<ul>
<li> <b> Do I need a visa to enter Canada and which type of visa do I apply for?</b> <br>

<li> <b> Travel tip: </b> <br>
